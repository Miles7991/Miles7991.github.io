<p>This post is to show how I built this personal blog web based on Github Pages from scratch, the tutorial I followed, and some point you need to notice.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-start">Before You Start</h2>

<p>Read the <a href="https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/"><strong>Chirpy</strong></a> tutorial carefully if you like this website theme. At first I’m so in haste to check my personal page and didn’t spend time on that tutorial. The result is I can run the website locally but after I push the project on the Repository it failed to generate the page on <a href="https://Miles7991.github.io">https://Miles7991.github.io</a>. As a freshman in <strong>Jekyll</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>, I waste a lot of time to find out what’s the problem. Then I noticed that Chirpy already told me what should I do after clone this project. That’s to run:</p>
<div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>bash tools/init.sh
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart"><strong>GitHub Page official Docs</strong></a> is useful but not for the guy who want a quick start. Hope you guys can calm down and spend some time on the right tutorial.</p>
