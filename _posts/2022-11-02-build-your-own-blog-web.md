This post is to show how I built this personal blog web based on Github Pages from scratch, the tutorial I followed, and some point you need to notice.

## Before You Start

Read the [**Chirpy**](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) tutorial carefully if you like this website theme. At first I'm so in haste to check my personal page and didn't spend time on that tutorial. The result is I can run the website locally but after I push the project on the Repository it failed to generate the page on <https://Miles7991.github.io>. As a freshman in **Jekyll** and **HTML**, I waste a lot of time to find out what's the problem. Then I noticed that Chirpy already told me what should I do after clone this project. That's to run: 
```console
$ bash tools/init.sh
```
[**GitHub Page official Docs**](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) is useful but not for the guy who want a quick start. Hope you guys can calm down and spend some time on the right tutorial.

## Useful Website

1. The most important tutorial is the [**Chirpy**](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) one, follow the Installation section. 

## Some Notices 

### Turn on the GitHub Action
After turning on the [GitHub Action](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/#deploy-by-using-github-actions) you can build the project and test if the website is workable:
